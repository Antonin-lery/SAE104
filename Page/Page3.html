        <h2>My study project</h2>
		
		<p>I have the objective to achieve a bac+5 so after the IUT I would like to get a Master in order to go to engineering school. 
		I also want to do a dual cours of study to gain professional experience and to compare my theoretical knowledge with the realities of the field.<p>

        <h2>My professional project</h2>
		
		<p><img src="../images/Pentester.jpg" alt="link" width="75%" height="75%" ></ ></p>
		
		<p>I don’t know yet but for the moment my choice leans more towards the job of pentester. 
		That’s why I want to take the cybersecurity option because the job of pentester requires solid knowledge in network and IT security. 
		I think this job suits me because I am patient, I like the world around cybersecurity and I have a sense of impeccable ethics.</p>
		
		<p>However, if after the IUT I do not have the ability and desire to continue my studies, I think I would make network administrator. 
		In addition, I would love to work in the field of cybersecurity within the army to help my country as much as possible .</p>
